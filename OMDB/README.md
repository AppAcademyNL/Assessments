Instructions: 
Create a client for the the Open Movie Database (OMDb), available on http://omdbapi.com. The app must implement the following functionalities:

1. Search movies by title.

2. Present the results of the search in a list. 

3. Each cell in the list must have a thumbnail image of the movie (if available) and the title. 

4. The user can open a detail view of the movie by tapping on a movie. 

5. The details should include a larger version of the movie poster and more details about the movie (year, cast, etc.).


Some considerations about the implementation of the app:

The app can use third party libraries just for the JSON parsing process; the rest of features must be implemented using standard Foundation and UIKit components.

The app should be able to handle error's in connection in a user friendly way.

The code must be written in Swift and the deployment target of the app should be iOS 11.
