# OMDb assessment 

For this assessment you have 8 hours. After you commit your work, one of our senior developers will review it together with you. Good luck!


Instructions: 
Create a client for the the Open Movie Database (OMDb), available on http://omdbapi.com. The app must implement the following functionalities:

Search movies by title
Present the results of the search in a list; each cell in the list must have a thumbnail image of the movie (if available) and the title
The user can open a detail view of the movie by tapping on a movie. The details should include a larger version of the movie poster and more details about the movie (year, cast, etc.).

Some considerations about the implementation of the app:

The app can use third party libraries just for the JSON parsing process; the rest of features must be implemented using standard Foundation and UIKit components.
The app should be able to handle error's in connection in a user friendly way.
The code can be written in either Swift, Objective-C, or a combination of both. Keep in mind that both languages are used within our projects.
The deployment target of the app should be iOS 10.
