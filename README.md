# App Academy Assessments

This repository will be used to post new assessments for The App Academy Bootcamps. An assessment has been handed to you via e-mail, choose the correct folder and follow the requirements to create your app. Please keep track of the time since you only have a certain amount of time for the assessment. If you're not able to finish the assessment, hand it in anyways. Some assessments are harder by design. This will give us a good representation of your skills and what we should work on in the coming bootcamp. 

### Delivery:

Work locally and perform your changes locally (but still using git). Once done, zip the entire repo folder (including the .git subfolder) and send it on time to assessment@theappacademy.nl. If the file is too big, use [WeTransfer](https://wetransfer.com/) and e-mail the link.
