2. It should update when you pull to refresh by reloading the feed into the app
3. Go to a detail view displaying a web view
4. The cells should look like the ones specified below
5. Paging, so more results are loaded
6. Loading wheel for web view page, and loading more results
7. Testing on low network connectivity
8. Add a search bar controller to search api for articles
9. Unit tests
Extra: Once you have done all this we can try to persist the stories in CORE DATA or REALM

The app can use third party libraries just for the JSON parsing process; the rest of features must be implemented using standard Swift components.

The app should be able to handle error's in connection in a user friendly way.
