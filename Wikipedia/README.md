# Wikipedia assessment 

For this assessment you have 2 days. After you send your work back, one of our senior developers will review it together with you. 
Clone the Wikipedia](https://github.com/wikimedia/wikipedia-ios) app.


### Instructions:
* The app can be called from other apps via deep linking.
* Modify the Wikipedia app so that it can be called in a way so that, when started, it directly goes to the Places tab and shows the location specified by the calling app (e.g. via coordinates), instead of the current location.
* Create a simple test app with a list of locations. Tapping on a location should call the Wikipedia app in this new way to demonstrate the functionality. 
* The user of the test app should be allowed to enter a custom location and open the wikipedia app there.
* No existing functionality should otherwise be altered. 

### Delivery:

Create a zip of your project and e-mail it on time to assessment@theappacademy.nl. If the file is too big, use [WeTransfer](https://wetransfer.com/) and e-mail the link.

Good luck!
